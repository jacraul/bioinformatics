1) Make an application that is able to find the alphabet of a sequence of text. 
This sequence may be an ARN seq or ADN seq or protein seq.

2) A DNA seq is given s=”ACGGGCATATGCGC” make an app which is able to show 
the percentage of the components from the alphabet of the seq s. 
In other words, the input of the seq s and the output is the alphabet of the 
seq and the percentage of each letter in the alphabet found in seq s.

3)	Use the AI to adapt your current algorithm inorder to make an app that 
takes a FASTA file and read the seq content from it and display the rel. 
percentage s for the symbols present in the alphabet of seq. 

NOTE: FASTA represents a file format that contains DNA, RNA or proteins seq. 
Thus, it contains the information for the input.
