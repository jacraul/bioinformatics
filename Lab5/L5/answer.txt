There are two primary issues with this algorithmic approach. 
First, there are gaps in coverage because random sampling isn't always comprehensive. 
Like our code did at 273 bp, you may be missing the single fragment that joins two larger pieces, which would cause the assembly to become "stuck" and fail. 
Second, repetitive regions: repeating patterns (such as...ATGCATGCATGC...) are abundant in DNA. 
These confuse a basic overlap algorithm, which is unable to determine which repeat to stitch on next. 
These areas will frequently "collapse" as a result, producing an inaccurate and 
significantly shorter final sequence than the original.
